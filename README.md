# Gocs

This is the (unofficial) Go client library for interacting with the Cloud Sigma API. It is *very* heavily based on the similar [godo](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo) library from Digitocean.

While this _can_ be used as a standalone client, the main purpose for creating it was for usage with the [sigmactl](https://github.com/lpmi-13/sigmactl) CLI tool for interacting with the Cloud Sigma API, so I could write up yet another k8s the hard way walkthrough that nobody cares about. lol.
